            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Pizza Dough:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
                <li>3 â…“ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Make dough</li>
                <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
                <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
                <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
                <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.</li>
                <li>and so on and so forth...</li>
            </ol>
